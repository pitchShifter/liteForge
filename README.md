A map editor framework that allows you to quickly import and use assets for your game. 

##Getting Started
###How it works
There is a subfolder called _maps_. Inside this folder will be a folder per map that includes everything related to your map.

When you work on your map, you will have full control over how things work. Want triggers? You've got it. Want to create an entity? You absolutely can.

My wish is to create a system that helps developers (including myself) quickly add content to their game. No restrictions.
