A map editor framework that allows you to quickly import and use assets for your game. 

##Getting Started
###How it works
There is a subfolder called _maps_. Inside this folder will be a folder per map that includes everything related to your map.

When you work on your map, you will have full control over how things work. Want triggers? You've got it. Want to create an entity? You absolutely can.

My wish is to create a system that helps developers (including myself) quickly add content to their game. No restrictions.

###Interface
The interface is very simple and clean. While you may not see buttons for copy, cut, and paste, the functionality is still there. Simply use CTRL + C/X/V.

The top bar contains four buttons: new, open, save, and exit. Simple.

Underneath the top bar are map project tabs. You can only have up to 3 maps open at the same time (the idea is to keep things clean). A > will display showing what map is currently open. 

Underneath the header bars, in the center, is a collapse/expand tab.

The minimap can be dragged around for your convenience.

The toolset menu can also be dragged around. The toolset menu is where everything will be: terrain, triggers, locations, entities, etc.

###Toolset Menu
####Terrain
With the terrain tab open, you can select multiple tiles at once. Simply click and drag to select the tiles you want.
